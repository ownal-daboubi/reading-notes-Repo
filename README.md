What is a growth mindset?
A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; 
intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.
By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success
comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

Reminders for growing mindset:
1. Challenge
2. Effort
3.Growing at work, and outside work too
